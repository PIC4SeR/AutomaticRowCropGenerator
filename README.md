## Description of the project

The code in this repository provides useful tools to automatically generate models of row-based crops for Blender and Gazebo.

## Installation procedure

Open a terminal inside this folder and run the following command:

``` 
    <PATH-TO-BLENDER-EXECUTABLE> --python install_requirements.py 
```

### Setup Gazebo environment

To setup the Gazebo environment, run the following command or pasting it in your `.bashrc` file:

```
    source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh 

    export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=<path-to-this-repo>/gazebo/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH

    export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=<path-to-this-repo>/gazebo:$GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH 
```
## User Guide

### List of parameters

The following parameters can be set in the `configuration.yaml` file.

__File names:__

- `plant_name`: name of the plant
- `terrain_name`: name of the terrain

__Field dimensions:__

- `magic_number`: a number, in meters, used to space plants and rows. Typically, it is the space between two rows.
- `row_length`: length of the row in meters
- `number_of_rows`: number of rows
- `rows_in_group`: the rows may be grouped. Between two groups of rows the distance is greater than the distance between two rows in the same group.
- `avg_plant_footprint`: average plant footprint in meters, used for spacing.


__Function parameters:__

- `generate_blender_model`: if True, Blender model is generated.
- `generate_gazebo_models`: if True, Gazebo models are generated inside _`gazebo/models`_ folder. One folder for each plant model is created.
- `generate_gazebo_world`: if True, Gazebo world is generated inside _`gazebo/worlds`_ folder.

### Models requirements
- Row lenght is disposed along Y axis, while field width is disposed along X axis.
- The origin of the object must be at the bottom of the plant.
- Plant models must be made of a single object, named _plant_. The _plant_ object may have children objects.
- Suggested options for OBJ mesh generation:
    - Forward: +Y
    - Up: +Z
    - Scale: 1
    - Path Mode: Strip

```


### Run the script

After setting the parameters in the `configuration.yaml` file, run the following command:

```
    <PATH-TO-BLENDER-EXECUTABLE> --python generate_models.py 
```

### Run Gazebo simulation

```
    gazebo worlds/<plant-name>_<terrain_name>.world 
```
